        This publication is a compilation of media in relation to the practice of bootlegging. In of itself, it is a demonstration of bootlegging. In this site, you can find all of the original source material the publication has been made of, along with the tools needed to <a href="make.html">print</a> the publication yourself. This publication is ever-evolving, and as texts are added and updated to keep up with time, the publication will change. All versions are logged and saved on the site so the changes are transparent and evident to everyone. And remember - steal, don't buy, from capitalism!
